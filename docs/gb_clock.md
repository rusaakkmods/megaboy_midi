### Game Boy Clock Rate Explained

The **Game Boy clock rate** refers to the frequency of the **Serial Clock (SC)** signal on the Game Boy link port, which is used to synchronize data transfer between two devices (e.g., two Game Boys or a Game Boy and another device).

#### Game Boy Serial Clock Rate

1. **Purpose of Serial Clock (SC)**:
   - The **Serial Clock (SC)** is a signal generated by the **master device** (usually one Game Boy in the link setup).
   - It synchronizes the transfer of data bits between the devices connected via the link port.

2. **Clock Frequency**:
   - The clock operates at approximately **8 KHz** (8000 cycles per second).
   - This means each clock pulse lasts around **125 microseconds** (1 / 8000 = 0.000125 seconds).

3. **Data Rate**:
   - The data is transferred **synchronously** with the clock, meaning that:
     - 1 bit is sent per clock cycle.
     - The **bit rate** is the same as the clock frequency: **8 Kbps (kilobits per second)**.
   - Since data is transmitted in bytes (8 bits), the effective **byte rate** is approximately:
     - **1000 bytes per second** (8000 bits ÷ 8 = 1000 bytes).

#### Timing of Clock Pulses

1. **Idle State**:
   - When the link port is not actively transmitting data, the clock signal remains **LOW**.

2. **Active Transmission**:
   - During communication, the clock signal toggles between **LOW** and **HIGH** states.
   - Each rising edge of the clock signals the devices to read or write a bit of data.

3. **Duration of Each Clock Pulse**:
   - The clock pulse consists of two parts:
     - **LOW period**: ~62.5 microseconds.
     - **HIGH period**: ~62.5 microseconds.

#### Clock Role in Synchronous Communication

1. **Master/Slave Role**:
   - In a typical Game Boy link connection:
     - The **master Game Boy** generates the clock signal.
     - The **slave device** reads the clock to synchronize data transfer.
   - This ensures that both devices exchange data in lockstep, without needing independent timing mechanisms.

2. **Slave Role in Receiving Master Clock**:
   - The **slave Game Boy** uses the clock signal from the master to determine exactly when to sample incoming bits from the **Serial Out (SO)** pin and when to send bits via the **Serial In (SI)** pin.
   - On each rising edge of the clock signal, the slave reads the current bit from the **SO** line or writes a bit to the **SI** line.
   - The **slave** does not generate its own clock signal but fully relies on the master's clock to maintain synchronization, ensuring that data is transferred reliably without discrepancies in timing.
   - This dependency on the master clock ensures that the slave is always synchronized with the master, preventing any mismatch in the data sent and received. The slave device essentially "waits" for each clock pulse from the master before performing any data read or write operations, ensuring a consistent and orderly data flow.

3. **Data Transmission**:
   - Data is exchanged bit-by-bit on each clock pulse.
   - The **Serial Out (SO)** pin sends data out from one Game Boy, while the **Serial In (SI)** pin receives data from the other device.
   - The clock ensures the bits are sampled and latched at the correct time.

#### Real-World Example of Clock Rate

1. **In Pokémon Red/Blue**:
   - During a Pokémon trade, the **master Game Boy** generates the clock to synchronize the exchange of Pokémon data.
   - Data packets are sent bit-by-bit, with each bit aligned to the clock signal.

2. **In Tetris**:
   - The clock signal is used to synchronize the game state between the two Game Boys, ensuring real-time updates.

#### How to Measure the Clock Rate

To measure the **Game Boy clock rate**:

1. **Use an Oscilloscope**:
   - Connect the probe to the **Serial Clock (SC)** pin on the Game Boy link port.
   - Measure the frequency of the clock pulses.

2. **Use an Arduino**:
   - You can write an Arduino sketch to measure the duration of HIGH and LOW periods on the SC pin and calculate the frequency:
     
     ```cpp
     void setup() {
       pinMode(9, INPUT); // Connect SC to Pin 9
       Serial.begin(9600);
     }

     void loop() {
       unsigned long highTime = pulseIn(9, HIGH);
       unsigned long lowTime = pulseIn(9, LOW);
       unsigned long period = highTime + lowTime;
       if (period > 0) {
         float frequency = 1000000.0 / period; // Frequency in Hz
         Serial.print("Frequency: ");
         Serial.print(frequency);
         Serial.println(" Hz");
       }
       delay(1000);
     }
     ```

#### Summary
- The **Game Boy clock rate** is around **8 KHz**, corresponding to a **bit rate** of **8 Kbps** and a **byte rate** of **1000 bytes per second**.
- The clock signal synchronizes the transfer of data between devices, ensuring accurate and reliable communication.

/*
The Game Boy link cable operates at a relatively low speed compared to modern communication standards. 
The Game Boy's serial communication operates at approximately 8,192 bits per second (bps), 
which translates to a bit period of about 122 microseconds.

Normal Latency in Game Boy Link Communication
Bit Period: Approximately 122 microseconds per bit.
Byte Transmission Time: Since a byte consists of 8 bits, 
the transmission time for one byte is approximately ( 8 \times 122 \text{ microseconds} = 976 \text{ microseconds} ).
Ensuring Reliable Communication
To ensure reliable communication with the Game Boy, you need to synchronize your microcontroller's timing with the Game Boy's clock. 
This involves carefully managing the delays in your code.
