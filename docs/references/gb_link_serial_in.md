### Should the Slave's Serial In (SI) Pin Be HIGH by Default?

Yes, the **slave's Serial In (SI)** pin should be **HIGH by default**. This is a common requirement for **synchronous serial communication** in the Game Boy link protocol. Here's why:

#### Why the Serial In (SI) Pin Should Be HIGH by Default

1. **Idle State Requirement**:
   - In the Game Boy link communication protocol, the **Serial In (SI)** pin, which is used by the **slave** to receive data, is typically set to **HIGH** during the **idle state**.
   - This idle HIGH state ensures that there is no unintended signal or noise interpreted as valid data when the link is not actively being used.

2. **Avoiding False Triggers**:
   - If the **SI** line were **floating** or left **LOW** by default, noise could be interpreted as incoming bits, which would lead to incorrect data being received or communication errors.
   - Pulling the **SI** line HIGH ensures that any actual communication starts with a clear signal when the **master** sends data.

3. **Pull-Up Resistors**:
   - To ensure that the **SI** line is HIGH by default, a **pull-up resistor** is used. In the Game Boy hardware and typical link cable circuits, there may be internal or external pull-up resistors on the **SI** line.
   - In a setup involving an Arduino or another microcontroller, you can enable an **internal pull-up resistor** to ensure the **SI** pin stays HIGH unless actively driven LOW by the master.

4. **Consistent Communication**:
   - The Game Boy link protocol expects consistent signal levels. Having the **SI** line HIGH by default helps both the **master** and **slave** remain synchronized, and ensures that the **slave** only reacts to deliberate signals from the master.

#### How to Set the SI Pin HIGH by Default

If you're using an Arduino to simulate the **master** or **slave** in the link communication, you can set the **SI** pin HIGH by enabling an internal pull-up resistor:

```cpp
pinMode(SI_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
```

- **`INPUT_PULLUP`** mode will connect an internal **pull-up resistor** to the **SI** pin, ensuring it stays **HIGH** unless pulled LOW by the master device.

#### Summary
- The **slave's Serial In (SI)** pin should be **HIGH** by default when idle.
- This is achieved by using a **pull-up resistor** to avoid noise or unintended signals that could be misinterpreted.
- Setting the **SI** line HIGH by default ensures clean and reliable communication, which is critical for the **synchronous** Game Boy link protocol.

This default HIGH state helps maintain stability in the communication protocol, allowing both devices to recognize valid data transmission more effectively.
